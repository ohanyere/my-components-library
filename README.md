# React Component Library

A modern, reusable **React + TypeScript** component library built with **Rollup**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** — designed to deliver consistent, accessible, and themeable UI components for scalable web applications.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a fully-typed, customizable, and test-driven React UI library.  
It provides essential UI building blocks — buttons, inputs, cards, accordions, date pickers, and more — all styled using **Tailwind CSS** and managed with **CVA** for consistent variants.

The library is bundled with **Rollup**, tested using **React Testing Library** and **Jest**, and documented through **Storybook**.
